## Goal

Using deep learning to find the location with the size of the delamination based on vibrations to calculate the life of the structure is one of the main objectives of the project. In the introduction, limitations of traditional methods included high computational cost and failure to receive 3 parameters of injury specificity. Therefore, according to the above, the method used for pathology requires a lot of data, which with the help of designed abacus models to get outputs from the reaction of the structure to the desired damage and use them to train ANN models. Therefore, the goal is to receive the best possible output from the ANN, which requires several methods to do so.
